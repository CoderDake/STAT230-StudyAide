STAT230-StudyAide
=================

The STAT230 course is notorious for being overwhelming. I put this file together to help study for the final. It contains definitions, theorems, and important terms for the final. Feel free to make changes and share it.`
The notes will be compiled so that they are in the .pdf document. If you need the study notes just download that.

If you would like to contribute to the notes feel free to download the repository and make additions/changes. I'm sure your fellow students will appreciate it.

ENJOY:)
